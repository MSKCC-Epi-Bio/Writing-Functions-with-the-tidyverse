# Conclusion

1. Don't copy/paste your code >2x, write a function! 
  
2. When writing functions using the `{tidyverse}`, need to account for the back-end
design of the `{tidyverse}`, namely data-masking and tidy-select

3. This is tricky! (and not super consistent, though recent updates to {tidyselect} make it easier to distinguish data-masking from tidy-select evaluation)
